This is a web application designed for a cafe business, built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ASP.NET. The project includes a stylish front-end interface with a menu, images, and multimedia elements to showcase the cafe's offerings.

Features:

Homepage with an attractive design.

Menu Section displaying different categories of beverages such as hot and iced coffee, smoothies, and specials.

CSS Styling using tooplate-wave-cafe.css for a modern look.

FontAwesome Integration for enhanced icons.

Multimedia Elements including images and videos for an engaging user experience.

ASP.NET Integration with index.aspx for dynamic content handling.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works:
HTML: The structure of the website is built using HTML, which contains content like text, images, and links.
CSS: The layout and design are handled by CSS, which ensures the website looks great and works well across all devices.
JavaScript: JavaScript is used to add interactivity to the site, such as animations, form validation, and dynamic content changes (e.g., showing or hiding elements).
FontAwesome: Adds scalable icons that improve the site's visual appeal without relying on image-based icons.
Media: Images and videos are embedded directly into the HTML or linked externally for fast loading.

üìú Code Breakdown:
HTML (index.html): Defines the content and structure of the webpage, including headers, paragraphs, buttons, images, and links. This serves as the foundation of the website.
CSS (css/tooplate-wave-cafe.css): Manages the styling of the website, including fonts, colors, layout, and responsiveness.
JavaScript (js/ folder): Adds interactivity and manages client-side functionality like animations and user input validation.
FontAwesome: Used for scalable icons that enhance the visual design.
